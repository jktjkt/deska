\section{Purpose}
This document describes use cases of Deska, Tool for Central Administration
of a Grid Site. Use cases are devided into two parts. Grid managing, which
describes managing of the grid and has only one actor: Administrator.
The second part, Grid monitoring, describes monitoring of the grid and has
two actors: Administrator and Manager.

\section{Use cases}

\subsection{Grid managing}
This part describes managing of the grid and has only one actor: Administrator.
