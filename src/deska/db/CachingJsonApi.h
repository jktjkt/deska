/** @short API implementation that caches metadata queries

This implementation of the DB API will ask for the metadata (the DB scheme) only once, upon the first request, and then
use that information to answer eventual further questions.  All functions for performing modifications are forwarded to
the real API implementation for execution.

In future, this could be extended to remember other stuff, like lists of object names etc etc, but none of these is
implemented at this point.

It looks like one can't create stuff like CachingApi<JsonApiParser> p( [JsonApiParser's constructor arguments go here] ),
so we have to stick with having having this "decorator" implemented as a dumb class setting the type of the base class in
stone.
