\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
\label{sec:acknowledgement}

We would like to express our gratitude towards RNDr. Filip Zavoral, Ph.D., our supervisor, who has substantially
contributed to the final delivery of this project.

The work on the Deska system was supported by the Institute of~Physics of~the~AS~CR,~v.v.i.~\cite{fzu}.  We are grateful
for the endorsement by the managers who provided partial funding, as well as to our fellow colleagues and MFF alumni who
are currently working at the Institute.  They have shared their valuable experience and provided substantial input about
the real-world operation of the Deska system and assisted in the multiple testing rounds and deploying the system in a
pilot mode.

Finally, each of the team members would also like to use this opportunity to say a sincere {\em Thank you!} to their
close friends, families and significant ones for their enormous empathy and support during the whole time.
