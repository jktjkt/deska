\chapter{Configuring the Database Scheme}
\label{sec:admin-dbscheme}

\begin{abstract}
This chapter leads the Deska administrator through the process of customizing the database scheme to individual site's
needs, as well as through the deployment of the database side.
\end{abstract}

\todo{Lukas: tell the user how to actually configure the scheme; that's the part of the end-user docs.}

\section{Requirements on the Table Layout}
\label{sec:db-scheme-req}

\subsection{General Requirements}
Every SQL table provided by the user needs to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Set {\tt search\_path} to schemas {\tt production} and {\tt deska}
    \item Have primary key column {\tt uid} of the {\tt bigint} type
    \item Have unique, not null column {\tt name} of the {\tt identifier} type; the embedded tables should instead use a
        unique pair of a {\tt uid} and a referencing column (see \secref{sec:db-scheme-refers-to} for an example)
    \item Use a sequence's {\tt nextval} as the default value of the column {\tt uid}
\end{itemize}

Following example shows a simplest table to be used in Deska.

\begin{minted}{sql}
--
-- This is example of a user-provided table for Deska.
-- It does not provide any attributes.
--
--
SET search_path TO production, deska;

CREATE SEQUENCE vendor_uid START 1;

-- vendor is the name of this kind
CREATE TABLE vendor (
    -- An internal primary key
    uid bigint DEFAULT nextval('vendor_uid')
        CONSTRAINT vendor_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    -- Name is the user-visible identifier
    name identifier
        CONSTRAINT vendor_name_unique UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
\end{minted}

It is not recommended to use table names starting with a prefix {\tt "inner\_"}, or ending with {\tt "\_template"}, as
Deska uses these names for internal use.  The total maximum length of a kind name and an attribute name is 20 characters
together.  Foreign keys have to retain the {\tt ON DELETE NO ACTION} stanza, a default option. All foreign keys also
needs to be set to {\tt DEFERRABLE}.

\subsection{Relations Definition}
Here we will describe how to add Deska relations (see \secref{sec:objects-and-relations-relations}) to modules.

\todo{Martina: add proper cross-references}

\subsubsection{REFERS\_TO}
\label{sec:db-scheme-refers-to}

The {\tt REFERS\_TO} relation (see \secref{sec:relation-refers-to}) needs adding the foreign key constraint. This constraint has to comply with following rules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The target module table has to be present in the database already
    \item The referring column forming the relation has to be of the {\tt bigint} type
    \item The name of the constraint shall start with the {\tt rrefer\_} prefix
    \item The foreign key shall always reference the {\tt uid} column of the target table
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}{sql}
SET search_path TO production,deska;

CREATE SEQUENCE hardware_uid START 1;

CREATE TABLE hardware (
    uid bigint DEFAULT nextval('hardware_uid')
        CONSTRAINT hardware_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    name identifier
        CONSTRAINT hardware_name_unique UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    vendor bigint 
        CONSTRAINT rrefer_hardware_fk_vendor REFERENCES vendor(uid) DEFERRABLE,
);
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{EMBED\_INTO}
The {\tt EMBED\_INTO} relation (see \secref{sec:relation-embed-into}) needs adding the foreign key constraint. This constraint has to comply with following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The target module table has to be present in the database already
    \item The referring column forming the relation has to be of the {\tt bigint} type
    \item The name of the constraint shall start with the {\tt rembed\_} prefix
    \item The foreign key shall always reference the {\tt uid} column of the target table
\end{itemize}
The tables that are embedded into another have to have unique pair of uid and referencing column, which refers to uid of table that is this embedded into.
\begin{minted}{sql}
SET search_path TO production,deska;

CREATE SEQUENCE interface_uid START 1;

-- interfaces of host
CREATE TABLE interface (
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    uid bigint DEFAULT nextval('interface_uid')
        CONSTRAINT interface_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    name identifier NOT NULL,
    host bigint
        CONSTRAINT rembed_interface_fk_host REFERENCES host(uid) DEFERRABLE,
    CONSTRAINT interface_pk_namexhost UNIQUE (name,host)
);
\end{minted}


\subsubsection{TEMPLATIZE}
The {\tt TEMPLATIZE} relation needs (see \secref{sec:relation-templatized}) adding a special column to the module. This column has to comply with following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The name of the column shall start with {\tt template\_} prefix
    \item The column has to be the only one column in module which name starts with {\tt template\_} prefix
    \item The column shall be of the {\tt bigint} type
\end{itemize}
You can template only tables that have at least one column which value could be inherited from its template. Columns that form some {\tt COMPOSITION relation}, {\tt TEMPLATIZE} relation or {\tt EMBED INTO} relation could not inherit theirs values.

\begin{minted}{sql}
SET search_path TO production,deska;

CREATE SEQUENCE hardware_uid START 1;

CREATE TABLE hardware (
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    uid bigint DEFAULT nextval('hardware_uid')
        CONSTRAINT hardware_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    name identifier
        CONSTRAINT hardware_name_unique UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    vendor bigint 
        CONSTRAINT hardware_fk_vendor REFERENCES vendor(uid) DEFERRABLE,
    template_hardware bigint
);
\end{minted}


\subsubsection{Multi-value Reference}
{\tt Multi-value} reference relation (see \secref{sec:relation-multi-value-references}) needs adding the foreign key constrain. This constraint has to comply with following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The target module table has to be present in the database already
    \item The referring column forming the relation has to be of the {\tt identifier\_set} type
    \item The name of the constraint shall start with the {\tt rset\_} prefix
    \item The foreign key shall always reference the {\tt uid} column of the target table
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}{sql}
SET search_path TO production,deska;

CREATE SEQUENCE host_uid START 1;

CREATE TABLE host (
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    uid bigint DEFAULT nextval('host_uid')
        CONSTRAINT host_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    name identifier
        CONSTRAINT host_name_unique UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    service identifier_set
        CONSTRAINT rset_host_fk_service REFERENCES service(uid) DEFERRABLE,
);
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{COMPOSITION}
{\tt COMPOSITION} relation (see \secref{sec:relation-contains}) needs adding the foreign key constrain. This constraint has to comply with following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The target module table has to be present in the database already
    \item The referring column forming the relation has to be of the {\tt bigint} type
    \item The name of the constraint shall start with the {\tt rconta\_} prefix
    \item The foreign key shall always reference the {\tt uid} column of the target table
\end{itemize}
In addition to requirements on module's foreign key, it is needed that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item This module and referenced module do not have any attribute with the same name (of course except {\tt name} and {\tt uid})
    \item The chain created by {\tt COMPOSITION} foreign keys of defined modules do not contain a cycle
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}{sql}
SET search_path TO production,deska;

CREATE SEQUENCE host_uid START 1;

-- vendors of hw
CREATE TABLE host (
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    uid bigint DEFAULT nextval('host_uid')
        CONSTRAINT host_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    -- this column is required in all plugins
    name identifier
        CONSTRAINT host_name_unique UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    -- hardwere where it runs
    hardware bigint
        CONSTRAINT rconta_host_fk_hardware REFERENCES hardware(uid) DEFERRABLE,
);
\end{minted}
