/** @short API implementation that caches metadata queries and groups related modifications together

This implementation of the DB API will ask for the metadata (the DB scheme) only once, upon the first request, and then
use that information to answer eventual further questions.  In addition to that, functions for performing modifications
might be delayed before they get forwarded to the real API implementation for execution.

WARNING: users are responsible to change the command caching mode to SEND_IMMEDIATELY before they proceed to use any "interesting"
methods like diffing, commits etc etc.  This is a limitation which might be lifted in future versions (see Redmine #404 for progress).

In future, the feature set of this class could be extended to remember other stuff, like lists of object names etc etc, but none
of these is implemented at this point.

It looks like one can't create stuff like CachingApi<JsonApiParser> p( [JsonApiParser's constructor arguments go here] ),
so we have to stick with having having this "decorator" implemented as a dumb class setting the type of the base class in
stone.
