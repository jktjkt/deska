Here is a couple of cautions.

1. The implementation is NOT hread safe.
2. There is a potential problem of manipulating SReadline and SKeymap
   objects from many compilation units.
   It comes up because I put all the data into a single header file.
   If you use the objects from different compilation units they 
   will have their own copies of the data and therefore the problem
   may come up. A single header file suited me nicely as soon as I
   performed all the readline related actions from a single file and
   did not want to create a separate library.
   A cure is very simple. You may extract the data into a separate
   compilation unit (removing them from the SReadline.h) or to create
   .so library. You also have an option ask me to do that.
