# There does not appear to be any reasonable way of ensuring that:
# a) the pdflatex does not prompt for input at all,
# b) the process stops on error immediately,
# c) no .pdf output is ever produced in case of an error
#
# The current situation (-interaction=nonstopmode) prevents interactive prompts,
# but still produces .pdf files and therefore masks the real issue.
# A reasonable workaround for debugging is to temporarily comment out inheriting
# the PDFLATEX_COMPILER_FLAGS below.
