Changes in version 2.1

  2003-01-04
	 - Instead of _using_ the macros YLMM_PARSE_INTERFACE,
	   YLMM_PARSE_INTERFACE_NAMESPACE, YLMM_SCAN_INTERFACE,
	   YLMM_SCAN_INTERFACE_NAMESPACE, YLMM_LEX_STATIC, and
	   YLMM_LEX_STATIC_LOCATION, the user should _define_ the
	   macros  YLMM_PARSER_CLASS, YLMM_SCANNER_CLASS,
	   YLMM_LEX_STATIC, and YLMM_LEX_STATIC_LOCATION. 
	 - ylmm::basic_parser now derives from ylmm::parser_base, and
	   ylmm::basic_scanner from ylmm::scanner_base, such that it's
	   easier to have a common interface to the parsers and
	   scanners, and so that they can be stored in a container of
	   sorts.  
	 - The file yaccmm.hh now takes care of defining all that is 
	   needed, including YYSTYPE if it isn't defined previously. 
	 - The classes ylmm::basic_parser, and ylmm::basic_scanner has
	   an additional template argument, that allows unique
	   identification and implementation.

	- The classes now all live in the namespace `ylmm' to not
	  confuse things further.   
	- basic_scanner is now a template, and the argument are like
	  for basic_parser.  This is so that the parser is now pulling 
	  things from the scanner, rather than the scanner pushing to
	  the parser. That makes it easier to make a pre-parser in the
	  scanner - for example to lookup typedefs, class names, and
	  templates.   
	- The documentation has been revisited. 
	- Stuff for making a Debian package has been included.
