/** @short Process the CLI input and generate events based on the parsed data

This class is fed by individual lines of user input (or the configuration file). It will parse
these data and emit signals based on their meaning, similar to how a SAX XML parser processes an
XML file.

Example: suppose we read the following input; the comments indicate the signals which the Parser emits:

    # isNestedInContext() return false
    host hpv2
        # categoryEntered("host", "hpv2") gets called
        # isNestedInContext() would return true
        # currentContextStack() would return (("host", "hpv2"))
        color red
        # attributeSet("color", "red")
    end
    # categoryLeft() gets signalled, isNestedInContext() is false and the currentContextStack() is empty

    host hpv2
        # categoryEntered("host", "hpv2") gets called
        # isNestedInContext() would return true
        # currentContextStack() would return (("host", "hpv2"))
        depth 10
        # attributeSet("depth", "10")
        interface eth0
            # categoryEntered("interface", "eth0") gets called
            # isNestedInContext() would return true
            # currentContextStack() would return (("host", "hpv2"), ("interface", "eth0"))
            ip 1.2.3.4
            # attributeSet("ip", "1.2.3.4")
        end
        # categoryLeft()
        # isNestedInContext() would return true
        # currentContextStack() would return (("host", "hpv2"))
    end
    # categoryLeft() gets signalled, isNestedInContext() is false and the currentContextStack() is empty


The following example demonstrates statements "inlined" to just a single line; we can see that the terminate
"end" is not required in these cases. The time goes from left to right. The whole line, ie. ("host hpv2 color blue\n")
is passed to the parser as a single unit, without any further structure.

    host hpv2 color blue
             ^          ^-- (2) Here it emits setAttribute("color", "blue") immediately followed by categoryLeft()
             |              the Parser returns to the initial state
             +-- (1) Here it emits the categoryEntered("host", "hpv2")

And another example, showing that it's possible to set multiple attributes at once:

    host hpv2 color blue depth 1
             ^          ^       ^+-- (3) setAttribute("depth", 1) immediately followed by categoryLeft()
             |          |
             |          +-- (2) setAttribute("color", "blue")
             |
             +-- (1) categoryEntered("host", "hpv2")
