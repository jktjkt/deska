	Changed name from basic_io to basic_output_handler

2003-01-04  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* ylmm/basic_parser.hh: Fix

	* ylmm/basic_buffer.hh, ylmm/basic_parser.hh, ylmm/basic_scanner.hh, ylmm/lexmm.hh, ylmm/yaccmm.hh:
	Instead of _using_ the macros YLMM_PARSE_INTERFACE,
	YLMM_PARSE_INTERFACE_NAMESPACE, YLMM_SCAN_INTERFACE,
	YLMM_SCAN_INTERFACE_NAMESPACE, YLMM_LEX_STATIC, and
	YLMM_LEX_STATIC_LOCATION, the user should _define_ the macros
	YLMM_PARSER_CLASS, YLMM_SCANNER_CLASS, YLMM_LEX_STATIC, and
	YLMM_LEX_STATIC_LOCATION.

	ylmm::basic_parser now derives from ylmm::parser_base, and
	ylmm::basic_scanner from ylmm::scanner_base, such that it's
	easier to have a common interface to the parsers and scanners,
	and so that they can be stored in a container of sorts.

	The file yaccmm.hh now takes care of defining all that is
	needed, including YYSTYPE if it isn't defined previously.

	The classes ylmm::basic_parser, and ylmm::basic_scanner has an
	additional template argument, that allows unique
	identification and implementation.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/simple.cc, tests/simple_parser.hh, tests/simple_parser.yy, tests/simple_scanner.hh, tests/simple_scanner.ll, tests/toycalc.cc, tests/toycalc_parser.hh, tests/toycalc_parser.yy, tests/toycalc_scanner.hh, tests/toycalc_scanner.ll:
	Updated to use the new ylmm/yaccmm.hh and ylmm/lexmm.hh.

	* doc/both.cc, doc/buffer.cc, doc/mainpage.cc, doc/parser.cc, doc/scanner.cc:
	Seperated the docuemntation of the various parts into seperate files for
	ease of maintainance and reading.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Bumped the minor version number. Added some news.

2002-12-30  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	Some debian stuff

	* .cvsignore, NEWS, configure.ac: Added a new sub directory, etc.

	* ylmm/basic_buffer.hh, ylmm/basic_location.hh, ylmm/basic_parser.hh, ylmm/basic_scanner.hh, ylmm/lexmm.hh, ylmm/yaccmm.hh, tests/.cvsignore, tests/simple_parser.hh, tests/simple_parser.yy, tests/simple_scanner.hh, tests/simple_scanner.ll, tests/toycalc.cc, tests/toycalc_parser.hh, tests/toycalc_parser.yy, tests/toycalc_scanner.hh, tests/toycalc_scanner.ll:
	Changed namespace of all classes to ylmm, and the macro prefixes to YLMM
	for consistency.  Also, there's less change that we'll get into trouble
	over name clashes.
	Also made basic_scanner a template, and also make member function to
	make the parser a puller from the scanner, rather than the scanner push
	to parser.

	* support/Makefile.am, support/ylmm-config.1, support/ylmm-config.in, support/ylmm.m4:
	Moved some files into this subdir

	* doc/mainpage.cc:
	Changed namespace of all classes to ylmm, and the macro prefixes to YLMM
	for consistency.  Also, there's less change that we'll get into trouble
	over name clashes.

	* debian/Makefile.am, debian/changelog, debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/dirs, debian/rules, debian/ylmm.docs, debian/ylmm.examples:
	Added Debian Stuff

	* BUGS, Makefile.am, autogen, autogen.sh, configure.ac, ylmm-config.in, ylmm.m4:
	Moved some files into the `support' directory

2002-12-28  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* ylmm/Makefile.am, ylmm/basic_buffer.hh, ylmm/basic_location.hh, ylmm/basic_parser.hh, ylmm/basic_scanner.hh, ylmm/lexmm.hh, ylmm/location.hh, ylmm/yaccmm.hh:
	Made the change debug -> tracing, debug_info -> trace, so that user classes
	may use the `debug' symbol for something else, like doing thier own trace
	output, or something.
	Renamed the class `location' to `basic_location' so that things are more
	symmetric.  Note, that the `lex::iostream_buffer' and similar are gone.
	Instead, `lex::basic_buffer' always reads from a `std::istream', shich
	ofcourse could be a `std::stringstream' or similar.  HEnce, there's no
	real need for the extra classes.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/simple_parser.hh, tests/simple_scanner.hh, tests/simple_scanner.ll, tests/toycalc.cc, tests/toycalc_parser.hh, tests/toycalc_parser.yy, tests/toycalc_scanner.hh, tests/toycalc_scanner.ll:
	Made the change debug -> tracing, debug_info -> trace, so that user classes
	may use the `debug' symbol for something else, like doing thier own trace
	output, or something.  That effects the calling conventions of the clients
	in the examples and tests.

	* doc/mainpage.cc:
	Fixed documentation to correspond with the change debug->tracing,
	debug_info->trace.

2002-12-27  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* ylmm/basic_parser.hh: Fixed a problem in trais print outs

2002-12-18  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* ylmm/basic_buffer.hh, ylmm/basic_scanner.hh, ylmm/buffer_state.hh, ylmm/external_buffer.hh, ylmm/flex_buffer.hh, ylmm/istream_buffer.hh:
	Removed various classes that I don't believe I need any more.  Now all
	the Flex specific details are taken care of in `basic_buffer.hh' near
	the end.  It meant I had to introduce the magic member `_extra' which is
	a void pointer, that in case of Flex is set to point to a YY_BUFFER_STATE
	variable.  Some new member functions was added to basic_buffer to deal
	with this extra data, and some member functions that where of limited use
	with Flex, and of no use outside of Flex, was removed entirely.  Also,
	the basic_buffer class can now track locations on it's own - thereby
	freeing some of this tiedious task from the client code.  One still needs
	to set the location arguments in the parser, as the basic_scanner and
	basic_parser classes are still completely decoupled.

2002-12-15  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* .cvsignore, autogen, doc/basic_parser.dia, doc/basic_scanner.dia, doc/doxyconfig.in, tests/.cvsignore, tests/Makefile.am, tests/simple_scanner.ll, tests/toycalc_parser.yy, tests/toycalc_scanner.ll, ylmm/basic_buffer.hh, ylmm/basic_scanner.hh, ylmm/flex_buffer.hh, ylmm/lexmm.hh, ylmm/yaccmm.hh:
	Intermediate checkin for backup

2002-12-14  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	Moved test suite to tests, and use Autotest

	* test/Makefile.am, test/simple.cc, test/simple_parser.hh, test/simple_parser.yy, test/simple_scanner.hh, test/simple_scanner.ll, test/toycalc.cc, test/toycalc_expression.hh, test/toycalc_parser.hh, test/toycalc_parser.yy, test/toycalc_scanner.hh, test/toycalc_scanner.ll:
	Moved this to tests

2002-12-12  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* test/simple.cc: Took out the debugging

	* doc/mainpage.cc: Fixed the documentation

2002-12-11  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/doxyconfig.in, doc/examples.cc, doc/mainpage.cc:
	Updated the documentation for the new structure of the base classes
	and examples.  Also added a usage section and an example section for
	better documentation.

	* test/.cvsignore, test/Makefile.am, test/expression.hh, test/parser.hh, test/parser.yy, test/scanner.hh, test/scanner.ll, test/simple.cc, test/simple_parser.hh, test/simple_parser.yy, test/simple_scanner.hh, test/simple_scanner.ll, test/toycalc.cc, test/toycalc_expression.hh, test/toycalc_parser.hh, test/toycalc_parser.yy, test/toycalc_scanner.hh, test/toycalc_scanner.ll:
	Renamed the toycalc example source files, and added the simple example.
	The examples have been revamped, so that they are nicer, and closer to
	what you'd do in a real life application.

	* ylmm/.cvsignore, ylmm/Makefile.am, ylmm/base_buffer.hh, ylmm/base_parser.hh, ylmm/base_scanner.hh, ylmm/basic_buffer.hh, ylmm/basic_parser.hh, ylmm/basic_scanner.hh, ylmm/external_buffer.hh, ylmm/istream_buffer.hh, ylmm/lexmm.hh, ylmm/location.hh, ylmm/yaccmm.hh:
	Renamed base_... to basic_...  Also, basic_parser is now a templated
	class with the semantic token type, and location type as template
	parameters.  This makes the yylex interface much cleaner.  The yylex
	interface is defined in terms of templated functions, so that it is
	much easier to adapt to different kinds of YYSTYPE, and so that code
	is on;y emitted for the function we need.  In case of none-pure parser
	however, we now enforce the use of YACC_LEX_STATIC or
	YACC_LEX_STATIC_LOCATION - there's no way around that, as we need to know
	the global variables yylval and possibly yylloc.

2002-10-26  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>

	* configure.ac, test/Makefile.am, ylmm/Makefile, ylmm/Makefile.in:

	Fixes for new interface.

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/favicon.png: More documentation.

	* configure.ac:
	Changed setter/getter method interfaces from `set_...' and `get_...' to
	`...'.. That's what the standard library seems to do, so I do that too.

2002-10-23  Christian Holm Christensen  <cholm@cholm.nbi.dk>
