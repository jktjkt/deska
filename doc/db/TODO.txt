* CODE STYLE
	- sql keywords case - may be, some script will help;)
	- naming files
	- we don't want api in fn-get-schema.sql file, really confusing
	
	= mostly done

* REPLACE LIKE in creating history table
	- it doesn't copy uid's bigserial type
	= mostly done - testing now

* module_DEL function repair
	- it need name - not null constraint...
	= done, calling with name, not uid
	- or get rid of not nulls?

* creating version number, storeing it for session
	= DONE
