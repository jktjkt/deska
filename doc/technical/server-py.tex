\section{Security Model}
\label{sec:server-security-model}

The {\tt deska-server} relies heavily on the authentication/authorization features offered by the SSH server, and on the
{\tt trust = ident} feature of the PostgreSQL server.  Any Unix user who is able to connect to the PostgreSQL database
which contains the Deska installation will be able to perform any modification to the database over the standard DBAPI
calls.

FIXME: this is mainly a placeholder for further documentation\ldots
