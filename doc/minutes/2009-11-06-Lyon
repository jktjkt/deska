Discussion about a database for managing resources at CC-IN2P3

Some suggestions by the database guy, Fabien Wernli:

- use proper API for abstracting away the DB (SQL) stuff
- don't put everything to the DB, keep it lean enough
- their system uses Perl stuff and DBIx ORM for abstraction
- lot of command line tools for querying the DB for various stuff:
    - is the host up?
    - gimme a list of all Sun Thor nodes which are up
    - in which rack is the Foo machine?
    - get pwr status of all Thumpers
- web view for administrative employees (inventory, accounting,...)
- unified IPMI tool which uses the info form the DB to automatically pick up the
right IPMP cli tool
- relation database allows you to be pretty flexible, especially in querying
- in the end, it doesn't really matter (sql/plaintext) as long as you have a
proper API abstracting away the low-level stuff
- plain text files might prove hard to synchronise
- otoh, DB has to be realiable enough and you need to have a local cache anyway

Stuff from Yannik (?), the system administrator from Thursday:

- use the DB heavily for Puppet (for example, integrating the up/down state of a
host to Puppet as a "builtin" field)
