\section{Purpose}
In this document we describe a class model depicting the internal structure of
the Database.  In addition, a suggestion about how to implement the whole
system, including the components which use the data stored in the database, is
provided too.


\section{Business Process}

\subsection{Class Diagram}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{class_diagram.png}

This figure depicts the model of the data stored in the Database.  Each class
corresponds to a logical piece of infrastructure that we are modelling.

\subsection{Component Diagram}

In this model we describe how are various components going to use the data from
the Database.  Please note that this is just a preliminary model which is
subject to change, especially due to some ongoing negotiations with the
Institute.

\section{Project Glossary}

For general overview and a glossary of terms used in this document, please have
a look at the ``Tool for Central Administration of a Grid Site'' document.
