* CODE STYLE
	- sql keywords case - may be, some script will help;)
	- naming files
	- we don't want api in fn-get-schema.sql file, really confusing
	
	= mostly done

* DROPing created tables and function
	- temporary workaround: grep "vendor_.*(IN" vendor_other.sql | sed 's/\(.*\)/drop function \1;/'
	= mostly solved - drop schema generated...
	- need to create the schema...

* REPLACE LIKE in creating history table
	- it doesn't copy uid's bigserial type

* module_DEL function repair
	- it need name - not null constraint...
	- or get rid of not nulls?

* creating version number, storeing it for session
