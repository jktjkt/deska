* CODE STYLE
	- sql keywords case - may be, some script will help;)
	- naming files
	- we don't want api in fn-get-schema.sql file, really confusing

* DROPing created tables and function
	- temporary workaround: grep "vendor_.*(IN" vendor_other.sql | sed 's/\(.*\)/drop function \1;/'

* REPLACE LIKE in creating history table
	- it doesn't copy uid's bigserial type

* module_DEL function repair
	- it need name - not null constraint...
	- or get rir of not nulls?
