	Yacc/Lex-- for wrapping Yacc/Lex output in C++ classes
	======================================================

This is a set of headers to wrap the output of Yacc and/or Lex in C++
classes. 

For some class documentation, please do (currently disabled)

    make doc 

and browse the generated html directory.  The code is really simple,
so read that too.
